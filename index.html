      <h2>Fatal Police Pursuits Dashboard</h2>
      <p class="dashboard-brief">This dashboard examines fatal police pursuits across the U.S. by race, location, and cause of pursuit.</p>
      <div class="dashboard-text" style="display:none">
        <p>In recent years, growing public attention has focused on the often-deadly consequences of police interactions, but one area that remains key is the fatality risk associated with police vehicle pursuits. These high-speed chases, sometimes initiated as a result of minor infractions, can often escalate quickly and end in fatality. Many of the fatalities associated with police vehicle pursuits aren’t just those being pursued, but also passengers, bystanders, and even police officers themselves. Furthermore, we see that Black and Latino individuals are disproportionately affected, raising urgent questions about how race, geography, and decision-making shape deadly outcomes.

This project uses public data on fatal police pursuits from 2017 to 2021 to examine when these incidents happen, where they occur and who they affect. Through a combination of three visualizations built in Tableau, the dashboard aims to surface patterns that are often lost in raw statistics. These patterns often point to broader systemic issues in policing, accountability, and risk distribution. For example, calendar heatmaps show that weekends and summer months account for significantly more deaths, while a breakdown of initial stops reveals that many pursuits begin for unreported or nonviolent offenses. A racial breakdown of victims compared to the suspected reason for the stop suggests implicit bias in how and when officers decide to initiate or continue a pursuit. 

Together, these findings help inform not only discussions around police procedure, but also broader debates about how public safety should be defined and achieved. Rather than treating every incident as isolated or tragic but unavoidable, we can begin to see structural patterns that point toward preventable harm and needed reform.</p>

    <section id="gun" class="dashboard-section">
      <h2>Gun Violence Dashboard</h2>
      <p class="dashboard-brief">Analyzes gun violence patterns by state, weekday, and season between 2014–2017.</p>
      <div class="dashboard-text" style="display:none">
  <p>This dashboard explores gun violence across U.S. states from 2014 to 2017. The hex map shows population-adjusted impact rates by state and year. The heat table reveals which days and months see the highest number of people killed or injured, filtered by state. The bump chart ranks the top 10 states by impact rate over time, highlighting shifts in severity.

Together, these visualizations show where, when, and how gun violence varies across the country. For example, Southern states dominate the rankings with higher adjusted impact rates. Additionally, the heatmap reveals that gun violence is most common on weekends and spikes during the summer months. This suggests that public interventions might benefit from targeting time-based risk as well as geography. 

This project is important not only for identifying patterns, but for revealing how different types of gun violence are concentrated and repeated—whether through intentional shootings, negligent discharges, or interactions with law enforcement. Presenting the data visually makes it easier to spot clusters, outliers, and persistent issues that would otherwise be buried in raw figures. It is meant to support a broader, evidence-based conversation on gun policy in the U.S.</p>

      <h2>U.S. Crime Trends Dashboard</h2>
      <p class="dashboard-brief">Tracks national crime rates by type and region from 1960–2022.</p>
      <div class="dashboard-text" style="display:none">
        <p>This dashboard analyzes U.S. crime trends from 1960 to 2022. Using FBI data from the Crime Data Explorer, it tracks the long-term arc of violent and property crime rates by region and by state. It also features a closer look at property crime trends in South Carolina.

The line graph shows the murder rate from 1960 to 2022 split by region. While the national trend peaked around the early 1990s, the South consistently had the highest regional murder rate throughout the time series. Property crime followed a similar arc but declined more steeply starting in the 2000s. A scatterplot was also included to show where each state lies in the violent/property crime space during the most recent year. This helps identify outliers such as New Mexico (high on both measures) and New Hampshire (low on both).

Finally, one chart is dedicated to South Carolina to better illustrate how a single state’s property crime changed over time. Stacked bars show both burglary and larceny rates. Despite South Carolina’s historical association with high property crime, it has seen a large drop since the 1990s, and is now closer to the national median. 

In sum, this project combines national trends and local specifics to better understand long-term shifts in U.S. crime. The tools support public policy debates by identifying where, when, and what kind of crime has changed across regions.</p>

    <section id="incarceration" class="dashboard-section">
      <h2>Incarceration Trends Dashboard</h2>
      <p class="dashboard-brief">Visualizes jail and prison incarceration by county across South Carolina.</p>
      <div class="dashboard-text" style="display:none">
        <p>This dashboard visualizes jail and prison incarceration rates at the county level across South Carolina. Using data from the Vera Institute of Justice’s Incarceration Trends Dataset (1970–2018), the project displays both long-term changes and localized variation in incarceration across the state.

Two choropleth maps show the most recent county-level rates for prison and jail populations per 100,000 residents. Notably, some rural counties have much higher incarceration rates than urban centers. Below the maps, a stacked area chart shows statewide incarceration rates over time, separated by jail and prison populations. The chart also includes shaded regions to indicate periods of national economic recession, which often correspond to shifts in incarceration policy.

A color-coded legend is included to help viewers see whether a county is rural, suburban, or urban, and identify patterns of carceral intensity. For example, rural counties are often the most heavily incarcerated in South Carolina, both per capita and in terms of jail-to-prison ratio. This suggests that county-level governance and local policing may be just as influential as statewide policy.

This dashboard is useful for identifying geographic and historical disparities in incarceration, and for understanding how decarceration policies might target the areas of greatest overuse.</p>

      <h2>Campus Crime Dashboard</h2>
      <p class="dashboard-brief">Compares crime stats at major South Carolina universities, normalized per 100k students.</p>
      <div class="dashboard-text" style="display:none">
        <p>This dashboard analyzes crime trends at the five largest universities in South Carolina, focusing on three key offenses: sexual misconduct, aggravated assault, and burglary. By normalizing the data per 100,000 students, it ensures fair comparisons across institutions with varying enrollment sizes.

The line chart on sexual misconduct trends shows both reported incidents and changes over time across campuses. It highlights spikes in specific years, which could reflect both increased reporting and actual shifts in campus safety. The treemap shows the average rate of aggravated assaults per 100,000 students, making it easy to identify which universities report the highest levels of violent crime. A bar graph shows average burglary rates per campus, emphasizing the vulnerability of student housing and predictable schedules.

The visualizations reveal stark contrasts across institutions. For example, Coastal Carolina reports consistently higher assault and burglary rates, while Clemson and Greenville Tech remain lower across all categories. These disparities raise questions about differences in enforcement, campus climate, and student support services.

This dashboard is meant to inform students, administrators, and policymakers about risks across campuses, and to support better decision-making when it comes to safety interventions and resource allocation.</p>
