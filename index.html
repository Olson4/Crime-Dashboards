      <h2>Fatal Police Pursuits Dashboard</h2>
      <p class="dashboard-brief">This dashboard examines fatal police pursuits across the U.S. by race, location, and cause of pursuit.</p>
      <div class="dashboard-text" style="display:none">
        <p>In recent years, growing public attention has focused on the often-deadly consequences of police interactions, but one area that remains key is the fatality risk associated with police vehicle pursuits. These high-speed chases, sometimes initiated as a result of minor infractions, can often escalate quickly and end in fatality. Many of the fatalities associated with police vehicle pursuits aren’t just those being pursued, but also passengers, bystanders, and even police officers themselves. Furthermore, we see that Black and Latino individuals are disproportionately affected, raising urgent questions about how race, geography, and decision-making shape deadly outcomes. This project uses public data on fatal police pursuits from 2017 to 2021 to examine when these incidents happen, where they occur and who they affect. Through a combination of three visualizations built in Tableau, the dashboard aims to surface patterns that are often lost in raw statistics. These patterns often point to broader systemic issues in policing, accountability, and risk distribution... (full text continues)</p>

      <div class="dashboard-text" style="display:none">
  <p>Gun violence remains a deeply entrenched issue in the United States, affecting communities in a variety of different ways depending on factors such as when and where incidents occur. While national media tends to narrow in on mass shootings or raw death counts, these figures often overlook important nuances such as the role of population size, regional differences, or shifting trends over time. This project explores those nuances through a series of data visualizations on Tableau that examine how gun violence varies across U.S. states... (full text continues)</p>

      <div class="dashboard-text" style="display:none">
        <p>Understanding crime trends in the United States requires a comprehensive analysis of both historical data and regional patterns. This study utilizes crime data from the FBI Crime Data Explorer, covering the years 1960 to 2022, in order to examine changes in violent and property crime rates. Through the usage of interactive Tableau visualizations, we explore murder rate trends across different U.S. Census regions... (full text continues)</p>

        <p>The incarceration rate in the U.S. declined from 2019 to the lowest rate since 1995, marking a substantial reversal after decades of growth in prison and jail populations. South Carolina’s incarceration trends closely mimic that of the national decline; however, significant disparities do exist at the county level. While some areas have seen reductions in jail and prison populations, others continue to incarcerate at disproportionately high rates... (full text continues)</p>

        <p>In The Reality of Crime on Campus, Todd S. Purdum (1988) explores the increasing awareness of crime on college campuses, challenging the traditional view of universities as a safe space. The article highlights incidents of violent crimes, including sexual assaults, murders, as well as racial brawls, which have forced institutions across the United States to reevaluate their security policies and student conduct policies...
